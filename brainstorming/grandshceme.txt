What does this app do?

I want to answer STEM questions, find them, browse them,select them, and do give screencasts (other mediums too)
and have them assessed by AI or possibly other people

Value proposition

* have a portfolio of assessed videos people can watch you be smart
* the videos are assessed to a decent degree which they can be considered valid
* the added value of archive and assisting in the most efficient way to learn concepts


Things I want users to say:

    Employer A "wow user X has answered 55 fundamental questions for my industry and has spent Z minutes in the past 5 months, thats impressive"
    
    User B "this site help motivate me and gave me structure to understand STEM"
