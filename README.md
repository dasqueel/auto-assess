# auto-assess
An api that scores your understanding of a question through a youtube screencast video.  E.x. do a screen cast answering "how to reverse a linked list" and you will receive a score on how well you did.  The score is calculated from comparing your videos transcript to other accepted screens casts that answer the question, e.x. (A khan Academy or geekforgeeks video)
